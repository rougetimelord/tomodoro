The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. These intervals are known as &quot;pomodoros&quot;, the plural in English of the Italian word pomodoro meaning &quot;tomato&quot;. The method is based on the idea that frequent breaks can improve mental agility.<br><ol><li>Decide on the task to be done<li>Set the pomodoro timer to n minutes (traditionally 25)<li>Work on the task until the timer rings; record with an x<li>Take a short break (3&#45;5 minutes)<li>After four pomodoros, take a longer break (15&#45;30 minutes)&quot;</ol><br>The creator and others encourage a low-tech approach, using a mechanical timer, paper and pencil. The physical act of winding up the timer confirms the user's determination to start the task; ticking externalises desire to complete the task; ringing announces a break. Flow and focus become associated with these physical stimuli.<br><br>This non physical (therefore inferior) version by Blair &quot;Rouge&quot;",
